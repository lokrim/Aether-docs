# Python for Computer Vision

Python is our primary language for computer vision tasks in Project Aether due to its simplicity and the massive ecosystem of scientific computing and machine learning libraries (like OpenCV and MediaPipe) available for it.

## Why Python?

- **Easy to read and write:** Designed with a clean, readable syntax, making it easier to collaborate.
- **Library Support:** Python has the strongest ecosystem for AI and Computer Vision via pip packages.
- **Prototyping:** Extremely fast to test new ideas or models.

## Setup & Installation

If you haven't installed Python yet, download it from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). We recommend Python 3.9 or higher.

To verify your installation, you can run:

```bash
python --version
# or on some systems:
python3 --version
```

### Virtual Environments

It is highly recommended to use virtual environments to avoid messing up your system Python packages. 

```bash
# Create a virtual environment named 'venv'
python -m venv venv

# Activate it (macOS/Linux)
source venv/bin/activate

# Activate it (Windows)
venv\Scripts\activate
```
